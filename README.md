# Overview.  
This project is a clone of the popular shortlet rental website, AirBnB.  
I'd be recreating the basic functionalities of the website using Javascript and React js.


## UI/UX Design Planning.  
It is designed to be very user friendly, allowing users to quickly choose an apartment to book, with detailed a page highlighting the features of the selected property and a page to complete the checkout.  

It'll have 3 primary pages; Property Listing View, Listing Detailed View and Simple Checkout View.

| Page | Description |
| --- | --- |
Property Listing View | This page shows the list of available properties to book and cost.  
Detailed Listing View | This page shows the detailed information of the each property (when clicked from the Property Listing View) and a checkout button.  
Simple Checkout View | This page allows the users to complete their checkout to successfully book a property.
